# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects, skills, and professional journey. Built with React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes. I built this website from scratch without the use of any UI libraries.

## Features

- **React Framework**: Utilizes React for efficient UI rendering and state management.
- **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript and React are used to dynamically update the content.
- **Styling**: Styled with CSS for a personalized look and feel.
