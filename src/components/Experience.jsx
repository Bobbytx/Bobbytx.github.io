        Having served with distinction as a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Air Force and earning a BBA in Supply Chain Management from the University of Houston before embarking on a 4.5-year tenure at Amazon as a Procurement Program Manager and Area Manager, I honed my skills in delivering complex projects, some with budgets exceeding $130 million/year, in the operations, logistics, and supply chain sectors.

        As someone committed to continuous learning and adaptation, I've recently enrolled in a Full-Stack Software Engineer bootcamp at Code Platoon. This program is enhancing my understanding of key technologies like Python, JavaScript, SQL, APIs, HTML, CSS, and React, along with foundational computer science concepts. This new endeavor bridges my managerial acumen with technical expertise, broadening my scope to contribute to innovative, tech-centric projects.I am enthusiastic about integrating this blend of skills to drive efficiency and innovation in future roles, and keen to connect with professionals and organizations at the intersection of management and technology.

        With my extensive experience in people management, supply chain management, and project management, I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to any organization seeking a professional with a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and leadership skills.
