            I'm a big sports fan! I love following my local teams and attending sports events. I'm always looking for new restaurants to try out around the city. I try to travel as much as possible to explore new areas especially scenic environments (work with me so I can fund this).  <a href="mailto:bobby.toth@gmail.com">GET IN TOUCH</a> to know more about me.
